Setup

Follow the instructions below to get your workspace setup:
CurseForge App (Windows / Mac)

    Download the CurseForge App and Git if you haven't already.

    Fork and clone the repository to the Instances folder of the CurseForge App, the default path is C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Curseforge\Minecraft\Instances.

    Note: If you've previously used the Twitch App the path will most likely be C:\Users\{UserName}\Documents\Twitch\Minecraft\Instances.

    Double click the script setup.bat to setup InstanceSync.

    Open the CurseForge App and you should see the modpack. If you already had CurseForge App open, restart it.

You're done!
